# CiFE-rs - Functional encryption library

CiFE-rs (prounounced as ciphers) is a cryptographic library offering different state-of-the-art implementations of functional encryption schemes,
specifically FE schemes for *linear* polynomials (e.g. *inner products*).
It is implemented in Rust.
A [Go version named GoFE](https://github.com/fentec-project/gofe) of the library also exists,
as well as [a C version named CiFEr](https://github.com/fentec-project/CiFEr).

Documentation of this library is [available on Gitlab
pages](https://etrovub.gitlab.io/smartnets/cife-rs/doc/cife_rs/index.html).
